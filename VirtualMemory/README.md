# Project 5 Virtual Memory #


## Overview ##
The purpose of this project was to build a demand page virtual memory. Given 4 unique page access paterns we were tasked with contructing and evaluating the performance of FIFO, random, and a custom replacement policy. The custom policy that was implemented utilizes a clock based LRU policy, but will switch to random if cycles are detected. For more information on project results or the custom policy design see the linked project document.


## Contributions ##
All files except main.c were provided prior to beginning the project. Within main.c, a rough skeleton and basic command parsing were also provided.
